CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
## Architecture
The frontend of the program was developed using a single-page application (SPA) that is delivered by Angular. Express HTML allowed for the interactive elements that users can use to navigate through the program. The backend of the program was developed using Node and Express HTML. The backend database is controlled by MongoDB, a NoSQL database, and Mongoose. 
## Functionality
This program uses JSON and JavaScript to store and transmit data through the program. JSON is the text-based representation of data that is easy for humans to read and write. JSON is a data-interchange format, whereas JavaScript is a programming language. JSON ties together frontend and backend development by passing the HTML requests from JSON text. There were many places in the code that were refactored to improve the UI. Most of these instances were in the HTML code to improve the layout and button functionalites. 
## Testing
Throughout the development of this program, it was essential to test consistently. Every time a new API was created or changed, I would test the program to ensure proper functionality. When adding in security features, such as user authentication, it was important to use a testing application such as Postman to ensure the program is secure. 
## Reflection
I hope to one day be a full-stack developer, so this course was my introduction to that. I enjoyed being able to use all of the above elements to create a fully functional webpage. I now understand how webpages work and are connected and how to troubleshoot webpage errors.
